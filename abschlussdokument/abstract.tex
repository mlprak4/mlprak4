In this work, we achieved autonomous driving in a 3D simulation based on deep-Q-learning. Unlike most related works, which mostly focus on self-driving capability for vehicles in games, we utilized a more realistic car model. As input we use raw image data from a simulated, low resolution camera and output a steering angle for the vehicle. We illustrated the evolution of our reward function and explained the reasoning behind every change. We evaluated each version and concluded the final version, which was able to drive smoothly inside the designated lane, to be the best. Finally we discuss possibilities to improve upon this approach.
